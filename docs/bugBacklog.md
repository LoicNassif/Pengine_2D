# Bug Backlog

## August 7th, 2019

### Resolved
- Elastic collision not working properly
    - Need to test all directions/cases manually

### Unresolved
- Odd behavior when squeezing circles between a collision and the bottom and top boundary
- Circles coming to a stop too often
- Mouse collision are only static
- Need error safeguards for window start-up
- Code refactoring needed using a physics manager
- Build a quadtree to localize and optimize physics computations
